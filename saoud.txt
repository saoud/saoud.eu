Hi, I'm Saoud.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>I have always had a passion for technology. I decided to take a round about way to get here but I am happy to have ended up where I am. I tried medical school overseas for 3.5 years before decding that I wanted to go back to tech. Even in high school I ran a small computer company where I would build and service desktops.</p><!- oqwipjefqwioefjwioqfjoiqwjfeioqwjefoi -->
<p>I got started with technology at the age of 6 or so when my parents got me an Apple IIC desktop. Since then I developed a passion for all things tech related and has it has only grown since then with a slight detour along the journey.</p><!-- owlsqweoifjqwoefijqwoeifjqwoefijwef -->
